## Overview
Background and analysis of the potential and the current market of the Citi bike sharing program.

## Results
Theres a total of around 2.3 Million trips made during August of 2019 in New York City, with over 80% of all trips made by subscribers of the Citibike Share program. This illustrates large customer base but also potential to grow the market and reach more non-subscribers. </br>

The majority of the customers of our program are on the Manhattan island, which should also be are prime target customer with high car ownership costs, high population density, and old public transportation infrastructures. With the starting and ending points of trips in similar regions we can assume that those who chose to use bike share tends to use it as a mode of transportation for work. However, more analysis is required to identify the pattern of bike usage. </br>

An analysis on the duration of rides illustrates that the rides usually falls under an hour, indicating short trips, which confirms our hypothesis that most subscribers lives on the Manhattan island with cycling distances to different locations (which commonly won't be longer than an hour). We can also identify from the graph below that there are significantly higher number of male users than female. </br>

The Bike demand by weekday for each hour showed that the highest demand are during rush hours on weekdays. The gender breakdown confirmed the overall data, with both male and female riders showing similar patterns. One area one can explore further is that the data shoed a drop in demand during wednesdays. </br>

Lastly, since majority of the users are subscribers, their data holds higher statistical impact on the overall results, showing similar patterns as our graph above. However, non-subscribers showed no obvious patterns in usage. This could be due to these non-subscriber customers being tourists or one-time user that chose Bike-share due to a specific reason, or that there are not enough data to show a identifiable trend. </br>

## Summary
The results allowed us to create an easy and superficial customer portrait of the NYC CitiBike Share Program, being a male 9-to-5 office worker that lives in Manhattan. If condition allows, the next step of my analysis would to trying to identify the moving directors of all rides, to better understand how and where the firm should place more bikes and the logistics of repair and maintenance.
